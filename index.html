        <li><h3>PhD Sport and Health Sciences ‘Exploring the aetiology of high burden lower limb injuries in male professional rugby
                union players’ - University of Exeter.</h3>
            <p>The PhD was co-funded by the Exeter Chiefs Rugby club. The overall aim of the project was to develop algorithms using
                Python (3) and R statistical software package to quantify the relationship between player motion capture,
                strength and GPS data and the risk of sustaining lower limb injury in Rugby Union players. I used a variety of data
                collection equipment including: Force platforms, motion capture, isokinetic dynamometry and a player tracking system
                incorporating GPS and inertial measurement units. During this project it was necessary to create and maintain a
                large number of databases. During my time as a PhD researcher, I have been able to foster strong industry
                partnerships with Codamotion (motion capture manufacturer). I have organised preseason data collection for the
                Exeter Chiefs Rugby club for the past five years of my PhD. Part of this project required extensive planning,
                managing and training a team of data collection assistants to ensure the data collection went according to plan and
                the data collected was of a high standard.</p></li>

            <h3>02/2021 – Present: Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service Information & Data Exploitation Architectural Services team – Data Scientist</h3>
            <p>In my current role I work to facilitate the organisation’s utilisation of information and data to inform business
                decision making in line with the current digital strategy. I achieve this by creating self-serve reports, bespoke
                geospatial analyses and FME server-based automation of data provision for a wide variety of DSFRS key stakeholders.
                More recently, I have gained experience of developing data marts to feed Power Bi and InPhase. This role has
                provided me with a wealth of experience working with the DSFRS databases, understanding their structure as well as
                the transition to the next phase of DSFRS databases. </p>

            <p>In this role, I was tasked with creating an innovative movement analysis tool which was integrated within the playing
            and training environment of sports performers to increase productivity, reduce the impact of injuries and optimise elite
            level sports performance. A key part of this post is collecting inertial measurement unit data to allow characterisation
            and analysis of on field player movement. </p>

            <p>I was responsible for performing biomechanical and strength assessments for players throughout the season –
                specifically on players returning from injury. A key part of this is producing subsequent reports for the medical
                and conditioning staff in quick turnaround. In addition, I collected and processed pre-participation screening data
                weekly throughout the season which was disseminated to the medical and conditioning staff during medical meetings.

    Example
    https://appbrewery.github.io/capstone-1-example



    Requirements
    In order to keep the project within scope (time, energy, resource), you can only use HTML to complete thing project. Even if you know CSS and JS (which we're assuming you don't yet), you are expected to only write the website using HTML.

    Imagine you are a professional developer working on this project. There will be things you don't know, things you want to do but haven't yet learnt how to. As a professional developer, you need to know the limits of your abilities and look up other things in Google, MDN docs, the internet.


    FAQs
    1. Can I use these Capstone projects in my job interviews?
    Yes! That's the point of these capstone projects. Unlike course projects, which have solution code and video walkthroughs, Capstone Projects are meant to be entirely your "own work". There are over a million students who have enrolled on this web development course worldwide. If you add a course project to your portfolio, it's very likely that your client will know it's from this course. The capstone projects on the other hand, have no solution code, no walk through, no design specs. It's it purely your creation So it can definitely be counted as your own work and be added to your portfolio.
    When I hire developers, I always ask for a portfolio. I consider what they have built by themselves to be far more important than which University they went to or if they have a computer science degree. Many of my friends who are CEOs in multi-nationals and startups agree.


    2. What if I don't remember how to do something, even though I watched all the videos?
    Watching a video is often not enough to learn a skill. That's why these capstone projects are a great opportunity to identify your weak points. While you're building, you'll find yourself stuck or forgetting how to do things. Great! It's then time to review previous lessons or online documentation to fill your knowledge gaps.
